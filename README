This is a personal project that I'm writing for fun. It involves automatic memory management and a set of utility routines and data structures to aid and accelerate development of C projects. 


 Overall goals:

	- Provide rudimentary, automatic memory management to ensure no leaks occur;
	- Encourage modularization and care for errors;
	- Provide simple and useful abstractions for, but not limited to, simple I/O operations;
	- Keep the system as simple as possible;
	- Have fun;
