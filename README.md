The Project
-----------

This is a personal project that I'm writing for fun. It involves automatic memory management and 
a set of utility routines and data structures to aid and accelerate development of C projects. 

Overall Goals
-------------

- Provide rudimentary, automatic memory management to ensure no leaks occur.
- Encourage modularization and care for errors.
- Provide simple and useful abstractions for, but not limited to, simple I/O operations.
- Keep the system as simple as possible.
- Have fun.
